# Adventure Time

Adventure Time is a travel simulation app where users can create accounts and add destinations they want to visit. They can add landmarks, or certain tourist attractions, to any destination as well as see other tourists, or peers, who also want to visit this destination. That way, a user can have a travel buddy. The Travel app also includes a built-in transltor so users can translate on the go when they are traveling!
